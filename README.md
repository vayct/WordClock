WordClock Display using RGB LED with Raspberry Pi GPIO
======================================================

The word clock aims to build a clock that is connected to a 
Raspberry Pi and uses words to display the current time in the day. 
Its use is pretty self-explanatory - it is a modern take on old grandfather 
clocks and adds tech to your home. The letters will be printed on an acrylic 
sheet and will be glued over an LED to produce a readable time. Further advancements
for this project may be enlarging it to include the weather and other smaller 
apps around the clock. 


Be aware that running the RGBMatrix requires root privileges. Therefore you will need to run all 
your Python scripts using sudo.
